///////// 12 - Greetings

//Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let names = ['fahad', 'narmeen', 'laiba'];
console.log(`Hello ${names[0]} !`);
console.log(`Hello ${names[1]} !`);
console.log(`Hello ${names[2]} !`);

//////////// 13 - Your Own Array:
 
//Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car,
//  and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”


let cars = ['toyota', 'ford', 'honda', 'BMW'];
console.log(`I want to own a  ${cars[2]} !`);
