///////////// 10 - Adding Comments
// Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment
//  to each. If you don’t have anything specific to write because your 
//  programs are too simple at this point, just add your name and the 
//  current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence 
//  describing what the program does.
